GILDA (Gunshot Identification & Localization with Directional Array)
üî´ Overview
GILDA is a real-time gunshot detection and localization system designed for defense applications. It uses a 6-microphone MEMS array with FPGA pre-processing and a modified GCC-PHAT algorithm for Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation, followed by a ResNet-50-based classifier for firearm identification. The system outputs real-time data to a secure GUI for military personnel.
